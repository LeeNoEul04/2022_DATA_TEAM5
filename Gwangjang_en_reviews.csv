"Come and find the lady on Netflix- street food. Be aware, her food stall is closed on Monday."
Traditional Korean market
"Honestly I don't rate it that highly. All the food in the stalls was cooked what seems like a while ago, so it all just sat there having gone cold by the time you are served. A lot of the food is very simple (Tteok-bokki, etc.) and not especially flavoursome. Most of the stalls serve the same thing too, so variety is less than it would first appear given the size of the place. It's an interesting experience but you get the feeling it's a bit of a tourist trap, with the associated average quality. Only go if you have a spare few hours to kill."
"Yeeeeeeee boiiiiii. Best food place I found in Korea. The hustle and bustle, the food stalls mmm mmm mmm. Make sure you get the crab from the banchan lady. It's kinda expensive but one of the best seafood things I had in Korea."
Amazing if you want to try real Korean street food and handmade noodles.
This is the place must visit in Seoul
I had a famous mungbean pancake with pork in the morning as breakfast. One person is too much but the taste is definitely worth the try. I went on Monday but seems like most of the stall were closed.
I enjoyed the market. The food market was amazing. All the different grocery stalls and food stalls are a wonderful way to spend free time.
"The market was not as crowded when we arrived, which was nice considering the usual lunch time craze. We had tteokbokki, kimbap, and oddeng at ¸ð³à±è¹ä and the famous mung bean pankake from ¼øÈñ³× ºóµ¥¶±. From a local korean¡¯s perspective, food was mediocre - I suggest people come just for the experience, especially foreigners who want to have a taste of authentic korean food market life."
Worth the trip! So many delicious foods and cheap too
The atmosphere! Go early evening. Buzzing. Feast your eyes on local delights. Have fun with the locals. What an experience. Be prepared for your clothes to smell after! It was fun. Not the cleanest but it was all about the experience and food.
Probably the most memorable spot in our trip - the bowl of freshly made noodles in piping yummy hot soup is simply heavenly for a cold morning in Seoul. Plus the very friendly & sporting owner posed for a bright and cheery photo!
A fun and memorable experience to go while in seoul.
Tasty confort mama food.
"All with its unique and traditional recipe, a good food market with a lot of variations."
Good prices and kind people
"A favorite place of ours. We go often and try new places to eat each time. You can find everything from A-Z here. Busy, crowed place. Just sit on an open chair and feast. Great prices. Once COVID a goes away things will get back to normal hopefully."
This place was nothing special from other markets around South Korea.
"Still worth a visit, just to take in the atmosphere. Most of the food is typical street food, recommend finding a place that has a lot of people. This usually indicates it¡¯s a pretty good place."
"There are a few Netflix famous spots, but don¡¯t let that be your deciding factor."
U can enjoy a lot of korean street food and
"Korea souvenir , gift , snacks , fruits are available here!"
This traditional market is the best way to know more about the local food culture. The aroma of the korean delicacies surrounds the area where most of the food vendors were concentrated and you will be spoilt for choice at the market. We feel like a local when we sit in front of the stall to try the famous mungbean pancake which is freshly made on the spot and it taste not too bad. There are also shops that sells korean snack and souvenirs that are cheaper than the ones sold at myeongdong shopping street.
"Delicious netflixfamous Mungbung pancakes, steamy hot knifecut noodles from the netflixlady, dokkbokki, soondae, soju, streetfood between locals at its top with heatwarming seats"
"Unfortunately on the second day of the lunar year, apart from the street food stalls and restaurants, only like 5 fruit stores and stores selling souvenirs and other things were open. We managed to get some probably overpriced kitchenware."
"Amongst the four streets in the market, three were on food. The vibrant food stalls were interesting to visit. And yes, the benches were ¡°hot¡±. The ladies and men serving were nice and there was menu in English, Chinese and Japanese. We also saw Chinese translators seemingly from the Tourist Associations standing by."
Should visit
"A true treasure in Seoul. I miss this place more than anything. The people, be it vendors or those who sit next to you, are incredibly welcoming and friendly. The food is incredible no matter where you go, pick what you like, but also take the advice of the friendly vendors beckoning you to their booths. Love this place dearly and you will too."
Loved the market as they are primarily run by local Koreans. Definitely recommend to eat at the makeshift stores like a local - the seats are heated and many sell local dumpling noodles which make it so satisfying to have during the winter.
This is also the place where you can visit the store which appeared on Netflix¡¯s ¡°street food¡±. Recommend to have the mung bean pancake and beef tartare.
Should definitely visit this place as it is near to Dongdaemun as well so you can always head there after this market
"Lots of stalls selling common street food. Extremely crowded and be prepared for lots of shoving and pushing. Found a stall selling fish shape pancake or waffles. The couple manning the stall were very organised and thoughtful. Their pancakes had only three types of fillings - red bean, custard or pizza. Tried all three and would personally recommend the custard filling. They were very generous with the filings."
"From Dongdaemun subway station, it was approx.15-min walk to market. We went on Jan.1, and the market was busy, packed with people. There were some stalls closed, but many were still open. Market has lots of food options, and things to buy, so you can spend hours there!"
A local market where you can find many authentic Korean food and shops selling souvenirs and snacks. Price are affordable. Sellers are friendly. Love it!
We went on New Year¡¯s Day so only the food stalls and a few snack and clothing stalls were open. The oil stench was strong from all the mug bean pancakes and there are dozens of stalls selling pretty much the same thing but we were too I adventurous to sit down especially when we have just had lunch an hour before that. The last thing you want is to horde a couple of seats and not consume enough.
"Great place to have lunch. If you want to try transitional cuisine, that¡¯s the place. There are plenty options in a super affordable price. Loved it, specially the dumplings!!!!"
"The street food at this market is amazing, weather was cold when we were there but still great to eat at one of the street stalls, seats were heated, so many different stalls with so many different street foods, tourists everywhere taking photos, this is a great stop for tourists and locals a like."
"Though Kwangjang Market had various item, but there was famous for Korean street food, Korean-style raw beef, mung-bean pancake, gimbap, and so on. If want to eat Korean street food, there was very good market to enjoy it. The inside road was small and many people was crowded. The price was nor expensive for trying food. The gourmet traveler must visited there."
Don¡¯t miss this place as you will find all the flavors the food and the Korean atmosphere!
You can shop and take away or eat inside on small casual tables it¡¯s so genuine!
"I think it is the beat food market in South Korea!!! So much great food you need to try, I would recommend coming here more than one so you can try everything"
"If you want taste authentic Korean foods as locals eat, you must go to Kwangjang Market. No where can beat this place for its variety and price. I ate there siting on narrow bench in very crowded center aisle. It was quite an experience. Fried sweet rice pancakes are very good. If you see many local people waiting in line for some food, just try it too. You have to visit this place when you are in Seoul because it is very difficult for tourist to find those traditional Korean food else where in the city."
This is a very cool place to visit. Lots of different things to see. I recommend it! Just walking around is neat
"I love this place because there are a lot of Korean food here. I ate bibimbap and teokbokki, but the taste was not really good. Somehow I still love the place because you can feel the traditional of Korea and how the local interact with each other."
"Kwangjang market is a really good cultural experience of Seoul - it's busy and noisy and a bit smelly sometimes and the food looks like nothing you would ever see in Europe! It's a great place to wander round even if you aren't brave enough to eat there - and yes, you can see the lady from the Netflix series..."
This market isn¡¯t as busy as Namdaemun market but is fully enclosed. The stalls are pretty repetitive but variety of food is still good nonetheless.
The market was an interesting experience to see and try out the korean street food! It is a bit crowded especially around lunch and dinner time but I think it¡¯s worth visiting. Make sure to try the food there!!
"As food markets or night markets go, this one is no more than average. It is part of a larger produce, fish, chicken and meat (and some clothing) market."
"Its obvious advantage is that it is covered and so a reasonable destination even in inclement weather. It also has two clear disadvantages: 1- the variety of food served is very limited. You have stall after stall serving the exact same thing. 2- the aisles are narrow. We were there late afternoon on a weekday, and there were spots where passage was difficult. I wonder whether passage becomes more difficult in the evening or on weekends."
"Anyone who saw Netflix street food will recognise Yoonsun Cho. The lady who makes and sells knife cut noodles and Mandu in Kwangjang Market Seoul. Since the show she¡¯s busier than ever but still make and serve the most delicious food. We loved the kimchi in particular. The green kimchi was fresh and different, delicious."
"We learnt that some of the market traders are jealous of her fame, they need to grow up as she attracts more people from around the world."
"The mungbean pancakes was also absolutely outstanding. The market is large and offers plenty of choices. Lots of blood sausage, bibimbap, gimbap and plenty other extraordinary delicious Korean specialities worth trying."
The market is also well know for steak tartar.
The soy sauce pickled crabs are delicious.
The market also offers clothing and homewares but definitely worth visiting for the food!
"It¡¯s a bus place, be patient and go with the flow you will have an amazing time!"
Whole long stretch of street food where u find live squid as well. Egg pan cake is a little bit oily but is very delicious. This place is very special where u can order food and sit in front of the small stall to eat. Price is reasonable. Next to the main food street there are some stalls selling cloths and sports stuff.
"We can¡¯t get enough of the mung bean pancake. We had it twice during our visit. We also loved the mini kimbap. Their bibimbap was also quite good. If we go back to south korea, we are definitely including this market again in our itinerary."
We visited by subway station Jongno 5-ga.It is 50 metres from the station.There are lots of food stalls selling multiple local dishes.We chose a family run fish restaurant that was popular with local people.We had kimchi chilli and cabbage starters and spicy pollock roe stew which blew our heads off much to the amusement of the Koreans.We communicated in sign language.Luckily they sold cold beers.A great experience.
"Was initially a bit confused and intimidated by the setup but eventually found it be a very way to discover new food. Not sure who is buying the clothes on sale but the food stalls definitely attract lots of customers. Just need the guts to sit down at one of the places and give the offerings a try. Seems to be segmented a bit by seafood, noodles, etc. Ended up having delicious food for very little money. Food stalls were closing up fast at 3PM when we were there so get there early enough to have options."
"We went there as part of our ""explore Seoul"" trip and it was worth it! The atmosphere and energy were unmatched. The ox head meat made it worth the hassle!"
"My family sat at a stall that was empty at the time (but as we finished our lunch all the empty chairs were almost full). Tried the great spicy tteokbokki and shared some mandu (dumplings), gimbap, fish cakes and bibimbap. Perhaps not the best food I ate during my stay, but very decent."
"The issue I saw was that most food vendors seemed to serve the same dishes and although I can¡¯t compare their cooking styles, this fact would make me think twice to return. When we went to see the Myeongdong Nanta show all the street vendors were offering their innovative cuisine in the streets (including lobster with cheese) and all the stalls offered something different. I wish this market offered that (or at least some type of) dish variety."
Easy to find from subway exit 9. This market is busy with food stalls & lots of variety. An excellent way to try a little of different korean foods. Other stalls for a whole range of products & goods. Various lanes of stalls spread out so you come back to a central point then take the next avenue.
"We watched Netflix show about street food of Seoul and it was a must do and see for us when we visited Seoul last week. We managed to find the stall from the show which makes the famous mung bean pancakes ??. The market was so big and it felt like it wasn¡¯t ending. You can find anything there: food, clothes, fabric, sea food ... it¡¯s definitely a must visit in Seoul as you will experience a real Korean culture."
"The Kwangjang (sometimes spelled Gwangjang) market is a real foodie heaven. Many resources on the internet say it closes at 6PM and this may be true for many of the shops, however the food scene seems to be going strong at least until 10:00 PM. Here you will find many street food classics such as mung bean pancakes, Korean blood sausage, dumplings, steak tartare, fresh octopus and many others. All menus are in English, I don¡¯t see why you would book a tour to come here to eat - read up on the Korean street food dishes and venture out on your own - I met several nice Koreans as I was hoping from stall to stall who was very friendly and wanted to share their food culture and their Soju with a total stranger. Geonbae!"
"Came here for the knife cut noodles and mung bean pancakes. Loads of shops selling hanboks, traditional decorations and snacks."
Street food markets always represent the beating heart of a country.
"Here, in Gwangjang Market, you can find the true traditional korean food."
There is a lot of attractive food; try as much as you can in order to have the most genuine experience possible!
Street food in abundance. Live fish for sale and local delicacies (unidentifiable to me). Sitting at a stall or one of the rooms is probably better than getting a take-away as the 'to go' option involves a lot of plastic and polystyrene packaging.
worth a visit to check out the food. didn¡¯t spend that much time here but my favourite stall was the kalguksu (knife-cut wheat flour noodles in soup) and mandu (dumplings) stall made famous by the netflix street food show (happy to report that it is worth the hype and the possible wait for seats as it¡¯s now a hot spot for foreigners thanks to the show). it¡¯s also a good place to shop for fabrics if that¡¯s what you¡¯re looking for!
This market is more about food than other stuff. You can try a lot of diffrent food. If you are around you should try to eat there!
Big markets. Lots and lots of stalls. Dry goods. Cooked food. Textiles. Linen. Toys. Souvenirs. Korean craft. Good to explore especially during rainy day since it is covered. The textile sections on ground and upper floor is enough to make you lost. All good price. Don¡¯t miss out the food stores. We had the noodle and dumpling at one of the Netflix street food featured stores. Not disappointed.
Went specifically because I watched on Netflix. Found the noodles and dumpling stall and the crab stall. Both amazing. Really good food from wonderful hardworking people.
"Fantastic market with heaps of small street food stalls. Pretty big area covering the block, heaps of stalls to walk around and can sit down to each at eat. Heaps of variety, catering for truly Korean food. Very tasty and fresh."
"Gwangjang market is a traditional Korean / Asian market. Lots of stalls selling all kinds of edible products, some raw some cooked. A great Street food location or buying some fresh fruit."
"You are spoilt for choice in the market for eateries. The centre food court has many small stalls that offer pancakes, noodles, rice rolls, live octopus, and more pancakes and more noodles. You can also purchase fresh vegetables, seafood and other raw food for your own cooking as it is a market. Another interesting thing to buy is cloth. Rolls and rolls of colourful and beautiful cloth are for sale here with many shops owners trying to make a living."
"Gwangjang market is the place to see the locals do their daily marketing. Besides the usual tteokbokki ( spicy ricecakes), you should try the fried mungbean pancakes, served with a delicious soy sauce onion dip. This market caters to the locals, so it is as authentic an experience watching Korean people buy and sell. A food paradise for people who love to eat or cook."
"Lots of great shopping and a huge center food court. Great fun, clean, reasonable prices. Loved the clean bathrooms."
"What a colourful and sense evoking experience with so many things to eat, smell, see and be a part of! A fabulous market. The kimchi dumplings and mung bean pancakes were amazing! Some good options if you are vegetarian."
"This place is a must see to in my book. I had a Seoul Korean native who lived in the States for 25 years give me a tour after moving back to Seoul for the past 11 years. Took me places that tourist would NEVER see and many Koreans don¡¯t even know about it. This was one of his stops and gave me the history of the Market and how it grew and expended over decades. This is the largest traditional Korean markets and is known for food, silk and anything you want to find. You can also book a tour through TripAdvisor"
"Went with my brother to have a good experience as seen online. One of the food stall owners was very pushy and persuaded us to sit down after saying she'd give us ""service"" (free food). We ate some and asked if we could take the rest of the food away as we wanted to leave quickly, still thinking it was ""service"". Also important to note I spoke Korean though I'm not 100% fluent. I was quite naive, and at this point she added more food that we didn't ask for. I then asked how much this would all be(as it was a lot for free food) and she told me it was 16,000won. I then felt pressured into paying because she purposefully gave us a lot of food without asking. The stall owner was very old and our Korean wasn't good enough to argue with her. My brother was also feeling sick. At the time, there were a lot of people as well as the weather being very rainy and humid, so we just wanted to get away as soon as possible. Make sure to be very firm with what exactly you want to eat and always ask straightaway as to how much the food will be or make sure that the food is still ""service"" if offered."
"Great Market Place to experience local culture & food. Many tastes of local Korean food like the Korean pancake, noodles, kimchi, gimbap, seafood & etc. Dry preserved seafood can also be found there."
The other side of the market is fabric area which closes in the evening after the food market comes alive.
Walk around Jungno-gu you can also find fruits & flower markets.
Tried all the 3 shops that were featured on Netflix. Loved the experience.
Netflix 1 Dimsums @ 5000 KRW were delicious
2: The raw crab in soya (very expensive 20000 KRW) for a small crab.
3. Pan cake (average - nothing special)
the experience and the atmosphere is super.
"This one of Korea¡¯s largest traditional markets, with one section selling authentic Korean street food. It is crowded with tourists as well as locals along the narrow alleys. For some stalls, there are some seats for customers who ordered pancakes, Korean dumplings, braised pig's trotters, gimbap, seafood, etc. If you are adventurous, you can try the raw octopus tentacles."
"There are also stalls selling fruit, vegetables, meat and fresh seafood. I purchased some apples and peaches, which were rather expensive. Suggest you buy fruits from other places."
"No, this is not an upscale, ultra-clean chain department store where credit cards are king -- it is a market with numerous food stalls are centered along the walkways and sellers of fish, produce, silk, souvenirs, kimchi, housegoods and junk line the walkways. For me, all the food looks alike but obviously some are better than others as they are very busy and others have no customers. When in Seoul, one really has to visit -- not necessarily buy, but at least visit."
"If you want to taste local street food easily, Gwangjang market should be one of your stop in Seoul. Easy, tasty and cheap."
"I went there with my korean friend and we tried raw beef dish and korean pancake, which is the popular dish of Gwangjang market. Both were delicious especially korean pancake. I loved it really. It is worth to mention that the vibe and atmosphere there was amazing. It was a bit crowded but that what you should expect to be in local market. There are many things for you to try there, so it is better to go with friends so you can try more dishes."
"It is really just a market solely focused on FOOD! Wonderfully authentic and delicious Korean Food! The shop keepers are very friendly and welcoming and can speak a multitude of languages ranging from english, chinese and japanese, so communication really shouldn't be a problem no matter where you're from. All the food is fresh or made on the spot and you can see them prepare it. You can either take away the food or sit down at the stalls themselves to enjoy the food items. Price wise, it isn't expensive at all and you are utterly spoiled for choice of what to eat at Gwangjang market. There is a lot to see and observe and is a definite must-see location when in Seoul. I'd personally recommend ordering the kimbap, japchae, jajamyeon, pumpkin porridge, tobeokki and the kimchi pancakes!"
It's like a food market where you can buy street food and walk along the street to find more food. Nothing special unless there is a specific food stall that you want here.
"If you love traditional Korean food, this is your heaven. Don¡¯t miss the kalguksu stall owned and operated by Yoonsun Cho, covered in Netflix¡¯s Street Food. Yum!"
"It's a nice traditional market to look and walk around, but the food section is very crowded and the food selections are actually very similar although there are many stores, and the food vendors would keep trying to sell you their food and may come off as pushy and aggressive which I really felt uncomfortable with. The food selections are mainly street foods such as tteokboki, mandu, fishcake etc, the mung bean pancake I tried was average."
"I was brought by my friend to see this local market. There are a lot of food stores, selling a variety of products. In the east side of the market, there are a lot of food vendors selling mungbean pancakes to cold noodles. On the second floor (or first floor if you are British/European), there are vendors selling traditional Korean wedding dresses (similar to Hanbok) and also second hand clothing."
Mung bean pancakes for lunch - yum. Shame you have to find a corner to eat them. This market is a food heaven as long as you can stand the crowds. There are some alleyways around - go for a wander and you will find some hidden treasures.
"5 sectors in this market: 1) food 2) clothing 3) Daily necessities 4) dried food and titbits n fruits 5) wet markets for seafood. Love the dumplings from one stall right at the end of the food alley. Many aunties are selling similar food but depending solely on each skill to attract patrons. The other alley are stalls selling korean costumes and modern clothings. You should bargain, but not too much. Another alley has stalls selling daily necessities, like towels, scrub towels, etc. And another alley has stalls selling the different types of titbits like seaweed cracker, seaweed, almonds. There is also another alley like wet market, selling seafood and dried fishes."
"We came here for lunch and entered on the textile entrance of the market. About halfway into the building is when we finally started to see the food stalls. The first stop was a fish cake stall where we ordered two, each W1000. Both came impaled on a stick along with a cup of broth. Both types of fish cakes were decent and the soup was flavorful."
"We were still on the hunt for a good lunch spot when we came across a stand with a large photo of Netflix on it. It turned out to be one of the vendors, Yoonsun Cho, showcased on an episode of Street Food. It was food stall #70 and had one of the largest seating areas which was a stand-alone stall surrounding the cooking and prep areas compared to all the others we walked by. We had to wait about ten minutes before a bench opened to accommodate the whole family. During the interim we watched her make some of her hand cut noodles and prep a number of bowls. Everything we tried was very good from the kimchi mandu to the hand cut noodle and the cold buckwheat noodles (we ordered spicy but it didn¡¯t pack much heat). Overall they ran a very efficient operation for the lines of people wanting to eat here and the food was reasonably priced at W5000 each for majority of the menu items."
There also was a mung bean fried cake vendor featured on Netflix but we were too full to give hers a try.
The market was crowded and together with all the frying the temperature got a little warm inside.
"The food section of the market was still buzzing at 7 pm on a Friday, other sections were mainly shutting down or closed. We stuffed down hand pulled noodles by the Netflix celebrity, washed down with rice beer, gimbap, tteokbokki and live baby octupus. Would definitely visit again and allot more time for discovery."
There are a lot of Korean local food and I'm not surprised that they are not that hygienic. The market itself is too crowded and I don't feel comfortable with it.
"Many stalls selling the same things, so pls read up or watch Netflix before going over. Have to try the mung beans pancake and knife noodles and dumplings. Go where the locals eat!"
