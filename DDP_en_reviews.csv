Tim Burton exhibit was incredible. Awesome place.
"A very interesting place at a busy area of Seoul, so many options of cafes, restaurants, bars and stores around it. It's thrilling to think that a baseball field once lied there instead of the DDP."
"art is subjective but i think most people will like the exhibitions and overall design of this plaza. i like it, that's why i rated it 5* :)"
This is a very nice place and big. surrounding many reknown shopping market...
A great place to hang out and look at art exhibitions that may suit your taste.
Beautiful Architecture
"Zaha Hadid's masterpiece is a spectacle to watch. It's just mesmarizing! There are enough amenitis for every designer. It facilitates and inspires. For Seoul, this magnifient architecture works as a global landmark."
"Massive, magnificently designed building with a few exhibitions inside, the structure itself is the real showpiece here though at night it looks ever better!"
good place to visit
Its a free spot to go and check out a neat building. They also hold exhibits there too. Right now is tim burton until september of this year.
It's more like museum and relaxing place. Not much things to do.
"I don't know what's all the hype about this place. To call a building ""futuristic"" or ""shaped like a spaceship"" is just another way of saying ""it's not organized"" and ""easy to get lost in"". I didn't understand what's the point of this design and I didn't find it interesting at all. It felt pretentious and not fun like I thought it would be. It is nice at night, with all the lights, but I wouldn't come here just for that. If you are in the area, drop by, but don't feel like you have to come here. You don't."
"Very good experience! Visited for the Tim Burton Expo, I was surprised, in a good way !"
"I really love the design of this public space that allows people to spend time with their family, relax, appreciate arts, and stay dry during the rainfall!"
"An amazing design, provided by Zaha Hadid. You feel there the sense of space, while you move it takes you through a journey of different feelings. Just there are alot of space are not functioning within the building"
State of the art design building. There is a design museum inside too. And a small shop selling cute accessories.
They need to announce that 10000 won for admission is for the museum only.
Super clean and interesting site
Amazing building not to be missed!
SHHEEEEEEEEEEESHH
"A unique place to roam around, take some pictures and chill at the same time."
Eye opening place about future life.
Amazing place. Enjoyed a lot.
The amazing architecture itself is worth the visit! I went for the Tim Burton exhibition here in June 2022 which is very well put together. I think there used to be some food trucks night market during the weekends but it stopped coz of the pandemic. Worth a visit!
The world of Tim Burton
"Place to visit. Unfortunately, we didn't make it in time for Tim Burton exhibition. But the building is really cool."
Never fail to please with their exhibitions and the architectural brilliance of Zaha Hadid
Nice place to visit! Shows different exhibitions regularly. The one at the time I visited was about Tim Burton.
Nice place to nap. Lol
"please no more beautiful and useless architectures, Zaha Hadid! Seoul city has been struggling and wasting large amount of money to find it's usages so far."
"Yes, the structure is stunning. Amazing architecture. Great atmosphere and lot's going on. However, expected more in terms of exhibitions. This changes throughout the year. Some boutique shops inside and eateries. I just think they could have made better use of the indoor space. Clean and well kept. Definitely recommend going."
Interesting art pieces around the plaza. Inside is a museum with special exhibits at times. Right outside is the Seoul City Tour double decker bus which you can buy a ticket for to enjoy sites around the area.
"I spent an hour and half walking and admiring, in the night, this structure that was designed by late Zaha Hadid, an Iraqi-born British world-renowned architect. It has certainly inspired me on the ¡°Dream, Design and Play¡± (DDP) concept behind the Dongdaemun Design Plaza (DDP)."
"Getting there: Take Subway Line 2, 4, 5 to get to Dongdaemun History & Culture Park Station and then take exit 1, which is connected to the DDP. Once you walk out the exit of subway station, the DDP just on the left. Climb the lighted stairs to reach the street level for appreciation of DDP."
The attraction:
"If you are at the DDP during the day, I would recommend a walk around the DDP to appreciate of the unique architecture of the structure ? it is built on curves and I did not see any sharp corner and long straight walls! It is mentioned that over 40,000 aluminium panels cover the DDP exterior of which none is the same. I would also recommend a walk inside the DDP - consists of a sky lounge, rest area, souvenir shop and 5 exhibition halls: Art Hall, Museum, Design Laboratory, Oullim Square and Dongdaemun History & Culture Park."
"It is at night when the DDP really came alive! The lightings simply accentuate and dazzle the structure. Most of the yellow-white lightings even ¡°moved¡± where these gradually intensified and then dimmed again. Participating in the ¡°night life¡± is the Rose Garden with a total of some 25,550 LED roses."
"Not only the architecture dazzled at night, the artistic talent was also on show when I saw and heard 2 different pianists playing the 2 pianos located in the open."
I walked across to the apM Place Shopping Mall and took the elevator to a high floor to get a bird¡¯s eye view of DDP. I think you can also get a nice view from the high floor of other buildings (for example the Lotte Fitin Shopping Mall)
"Overall, I enjoyed Dongdaemun Design Plaza (DDP) in the night more than in the day. Nevertheless, this is one iconic landmark in Seoul that you would not want to miss! It is no wonder that many Korean dramas were filmed here as well, including ¡°You Who Came from the Stars¡±, ¡°Producer¡± and ¡°She Was Pretty¡±."
Zaha Hadid¡¯s Dongdaemun Design Park &Plaza is the highlight of my trip to South Korea. We arrived in the evening and there was a performance with music and high tech projections on the walls of the building. We really felt like being in the center of arts and technology! Breathtaking ! Strongly recommend!
"I enjoyed a really lovely and romantic (despite being by myself) walk through this area late one evening. All of the shops were closing up, including the street vendors but it was still great for an evening stroll."
I visited there two times. The structure of this architecture is so dynamic that I felt like I'm in city rather than architecture. It was memorable
"I went there two times, AM and PM. The night scenery is so beautiful. So many places to take photos. Outside the building, there are roses being displayed (actually for kdrama shooting, but somehow they left it there as it become famous with tourists). I would like to recommed coming here during the night."
For me it was a bit disappointing visiting S. Korea. I can feel a bit of tension wherever I would go around the city. The people were not as warm as expected. I don¡¯t know if it was due to a language barrier or they were just not trying to be nice. I¡¯m Caucasian and my wife is Japanese and at a lot of places we went I didn¡¯t really enjoy myself. It was our first time visiting. But as for me I probably won¡¯t go back again. This is my opinion
"Definitively worth a visit, especially if you are interested in design and arts."
"Depend on what exhibition will be held during your visit, but even without interesting exhibition, you can visit the building during a sunny day."
From the outside amazing architecture; just simply amazing but as soon as you step inside the magic disappear rapidly.
The space seems to be very poorly used and there is so little design that you wonder where you are.
So much potential totally wasted.
"Weird and cool architecture, just walk around outside and inside for awhile and get lost. Some cool exhibits, food, and shops!"
Nothing much here but nice walk around. It surroundings by few shopping complex which offering various types of things. There is food truck (night market) and performances during weekend if not mistaken. Please check before you go.
"Modern building, interesting construction, rice lights every nights, them exhibitions almost every month. Just see it"
"A short walk from the JW Marriott Dongdaemun Square Seoul leads to one of the world¡¯s most impressive and incredible architectural designs, the free flowing futuristic structure of the Dongdaemun Design Plaza (known as the DDP) where history marries the present and embraces the future."
"Designed by the late internationally acclaimed Pritzker Architecture Prize recipient, visionary Zaha Hadid, Dongdaemun Design Plaza, frequented by both tourists and locals, greets all with the notable humanistic art of architecture."
"It imparts a feeling of liquid, fluid metal."
"Seoul, the capital city of South Korea, home to 10 million people, is a modern world mega-city, designated in the year 2010 as the ¡°World Design Capital.¡± It is indeed fitting that he Dongdaemun Design Plaza so elegantly captures the beauty and energy of Seoul."
"The Dongdaemun Design Plaza is home to the Dongdaemun History and Culture Park, featuring the Dongdaemun Relic Area 2, an archaeological site discovered at the former baseball field of the Dongdaemun Stadium Complex, yielding knowledge about the life of Korean people during the Joseon period."
The tile-paved path believed to relate to the Japanese colonial period connects the building sites and the Well Site and Fireplace Feature depicted along the path.
The dual-languages of the signage of the site are Korean and English.
"In the midst of this extraordinary mega-city of Seoul, resides peace and tranquility."
"The Dongdaemun Design Plaza also is home to eateries, coffee shops, art, gigantic sculptures, a rooftop park, bi-lingual tours of the Dongdaemun Design Plaza, and so much more to experience."
"There is very little I can tell you about this outstanding and gorgeous piece of engineering and architecture. Designed by world renowned architect, Zaha Hadid who is an Iraqi/British citizen.."
The place has conveniently allocated metro entrances beneath the structure. I think 3 to be precise. Before you get to the building there is a mayor plaza and a walking street/ramp that leads you to the heart of it. The entrance is beneath the full structure.
"The DDP of its name means: Dongdaemun Design Plaza (DDP) has the meaning of 'Dream, Design and Play' as far as I was informed. The place is also famous and renowned for it has staged diverse cultural events including exhibitions, fashion shows, product launch shows, forums and conferences."
"DDP's exterior features over 40,000 aluminum panels, none of which are the same. As I mentioned before the plaza is home to various exhibition spaces, design museum, sky lounge, rest area and a souvenir shop."
"Is really a beauty of Art, and Architecture as well as Technology. We recommend it for a casual visit, to attend an event or if you are all of the above; artist, architect or engineer. You'll be mesmerized."
DDP LED Rose Garden is closed when we get there. :( So frustrated not to find it while thinking that it should be where it should be. Didn't get any review or advise online that it will be closed so sharing this post which hopefully would help those who plan to go to DDP to see this LED Rose Garden. Please check operating hours or any announcement before you go.
The website or it's advertising stresses to get here at dusk! However by dusk only a few shops are open!
The Plaza would be busier if your opening times were more precise. Architecturally the structure is definitely
"worth visiting, the design is exciting and futuristic! The interior seems unfinished and lacking in spatial flow."
Nice place to just sit by the steps and enjoy the cold. Great for taking pictures as well.
Occasionally they have exhibitions here but unfortunately when we went it was already over.
"such an amazing architecture,a piece of art and history by Zaha Hadid, where the future meets fantasy design takes your breath away. Free admittance other than into galleries and class. Feel free to walk in and dont trip while your head will be looking up at amazing futuristic style of design, and down at the assymetric stairs etc. cool cafes inside, art classes, bookstore, seating areas- plenty to do."
Will not visit again.
Interesting building design from the outside but boring on the inside.
Noting much to do inside.
They have Dongdaemun show every night during the winter break.
To have artistic show projected on the enormous surface of the Iraqi American designed structure was a sight to behold!
"Excellent gallery, beautiful building, world-class art. We went during winter and it was great to have some time away from the cold."
"A truly impressive futuristic, sci fi looking complex that deserves a wow factor on first impression especially if you just exited the subway stop. The grounds and surrounding area are massive you could easily spend two days exploring this area as it also includes historical Dongdaemun wall and gate parkway etc. The DDP is an art gallery design complex that has numerous spaces and rooms for outdoor performances and conferences. Another interesting factor that there are archelogical finds surrounding the complex area that was unearth during construction and this has been integrated into the overall area. This is an outstanding architectural design complex that is impressive when viewed both during the daylight and evening hours."
"This beautifully designed building is part of the Design Plaza, with regularly exhibitions and performances. There is a small food court area and with few cafes around the basement level of the Plaza. It is also a good place to wait for the HopOn HopOff tour buses which makes DDP their main stop for both lines.... Right across the street and surrounding areas are 5-6 large department stores, some which are opened till 4-5am."
Vast building designed by Zaha Hadid covering a few city blocks. Definitely worth a visit. Various shops and galleries inside and usually a lively market outside.
The building design itself is interesting. Sloping corridor to get to the various levels that locate the museum.
"From the outside, it looks like a gigantic docked spaceship. It has two sections, the design plaza on one side and a museum on the other."
"When you are done, the shopping is simply overwhelming. This is the place for those that do not fancy the bazaar style shopping as in Namdaemun market. This place has a few big malls for fashion mostly. It has even has two underground shopping malls. One at the main street and the other is adjoining the Metro station."
Good for photo opp and place to shop
"The structure of DDP itself loks futuristic, something like out of a Star Trek movie. However there are not many shops in there and can look deserted. I guess you have to appreciate art or design, for me there is not much to see except the structure itself"
The architectural facade of DDP is very unique. Outside the building is a good place for watching people and drinking coffee.
"It is a iconic piece of architecture on a monumental scale. It was a huge disappointment though, there was almost no content and so much of the museum space was closed or empty. The shopping area was billed as a design market, it was not at all curated as ¡°design¡± goods. The remains of historical buildings in and amongst the futuristic mega buildings were the most interesting parts of the park. Overall, the sheer bleakness of the interior was fascinating, but I was very frustrated at the lack of museum content. The one small exhibit gallery with exhibits in it was okay, but not of a scale to fit this giant park. So, be aware that besides the giant swooping building, there isn¡¯t anything else to see."
"The central stair in the design building is amazing, there is some striking architecture."
"Beautiful, artistic architecture that houses a museum, a kids playground, a gift shop and underground shopping mall. Take the lift up to the roof top and strolled down the ramp while admiring the wonderful view!"
"Located in the heart of Seoul, this Plaza certainly stands out for its futuristic design! There's a small museum nearby that goes into great detail about the flood control measures that have been implemented. Some ruins have been preserved as well."
"Also caled DDP. This space ship is a major urban and most iconic landmark in Seoul. Build by Zaha Hadid Architects this neo-futuristic eccentric compkex is a multipurpose cultural center with galleries, event spaces, design shops and lawns that rise up to its roof. Here is the perfect place to shop 24-hour high quality goods."
It¡¯s too cold to truly enjoy the outside of the structure . Great to see the place. Luckily there are indoor place to eat and some small shop/store - I didn¡¯t buy anything there. Also good to sit around have some snacks
"Visit exhibitions , souvenir shops , enjoy a cup of coffee or a meal in this mega structure."
DDP is an architectural beauty that was design by the queen of the crazy structures the late (Zaha Hadid). It¡¯s not your typical exhibition center it¡¯s a place that you can do multiple activities in while enjoying this crazy structural beauty in a district that never sleeps
"This building symbolises modem South Korea with its futuristic design. The building? is lighted up in the night. Inside is a? kind of shopping mall with shops, restaurants and halls for exhibitions and cultural programs."
Very nice to walk around and see this very modern building. Nice and not so big shopping mall as well
The design is breathtaking - and very massive. The surrounding areas offer a lot of cool shopping and eating spots.
"This area is one of the best place to shop but this time, we went here to enjoy the cold weather and take lots of pictures here! Truly a wonderful place for photography"
I stopped by at the DDP at nighttime with some friends and it was a great visit. The architectural design of the plaza itself is so unique and definitely worth some photos. I believe they tend to have some exhibits are art programs here sometimes but you'll have to check out their website. There is a History Museum that you can check out as well with free admission.
