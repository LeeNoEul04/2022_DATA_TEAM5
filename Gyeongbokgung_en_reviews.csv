"One of the most well-known attraction in Seoul which is worth a quick visit. In the palace itself there isn¡¯t much to do apart from just walking around and seeing the historic buildings. You also can¡¯t enter any of the buildings which means it can be quite hot in the summer. Personally, I would just do a quick walk around of the palace then head to the two museums either side of the palace as there¡¯s a lot more to see there. The entry fee is quite reasonable and there¡¯s also discounts available."
"Korean Palace situated on the north end of Seoul nearby a lot of the old Seoul. There are few dozen rental places left of the palace where you can rent Korean traditional dress for about 15,000 won per hour. You get in free if you wearing one so very fun experience."
"Very hot in beginning of August, but still worth the experience!"
Absolutely beautiful!
"Just something you should definitely see on your first trip to Seoul. The culture and history is important! A lot of people rented hanboks (although it was the end of July and blazing hot outside) and we¡¯re wearing them for pictures and to walk around. Side note: if you rent hanboks you can get into all of the palaces for free. The palace was stunning. We got some cool pictures. You can get around with a stroller- it¡¯s just not that easy. Also. I suggest if you¡¯re going to come here don¡¯t do it during the middle of the summer and in the hottest part of the afternoon. I felt like I was roasting. Bring lots of water! Prices to enter are cheap. 3,000 krw per adult and children 9 and under are free. We¡¯re glad we went!"
Incredible cultural experience with beautiful historical architecture. Guided tours are provided in English and are free. The palace is massive and has plenty of places to explore outside of the guided tour.
Really wanna back soon
"I guess South Korean's palaces are paler in comparison to Chinese ones. Different culture different expression, you'd have to manage your expectations. It's a must place to go if you are visiting South Korea, at least once. I'd advise against visiting during summer when the temperature rises as there's not many trees around, the grounds look plain and wide and not as lush as i expected. So, yeah, manage your expectation and you'll enjoy this piece of history."
"Beautiful architecture, plenty of different areas to walk around in and lots of opportunities for pictures. People are usually very nice there which adds to the whole experience."
Very nice place know Korean history. Try to get English tour which is free.
I guess this is a must visit attraction in Seoul. Come here to see the palace and try traditional Korean costume
Like it Beautiful hanbook
Very much a tourist hotspot. Expect people to be pushy and rude at times. Beautiful landmark. Additional museums behind the palace.
"Gyeongbokgung Palace is a palace located in the north of Seoul, South Korea. Gyeongbok Palace is one of the 5 great palaces and is the largest built by the Joseon Dynasty"
Beautiful palace. I wish I had more time to explore without my family since they weren't into it as much as I was so they were getting annoying. But the grounds were pretty and it was cool to see some Korean history wrapped up in the middle of modern korea.
Place is good for tourisment
I love v baby ?? and BTS army my dream ?? please in south Korea ??
Same as the other palaces
So amazing experience. I hope that many cultural assets in Korea will be known and well preserved. I was proud to be here.
I was expecting to see a bit more but felt attraction was a bit limited. The palaces were decent
"Place is bigger than i expected, lots to see, can be boring if ure not into history, tickets were very cheap, can't go in the temples, would be great with a small kiosk where we can buy a cold drink."
Absolutely must see landmark. Bring a nice camera you won¡¯t be sorry! Feels like you are lost in time¡¦
I saw the changing of the guard and then toured the grounds. Both were stunning. The grounds are exposed so come prepared. Id recommend a tour ao you can learn all the intricacies of the design and their meanings. Definitely recommend.
"Priceless. Have to go there with a friend (unless you have photographer)z Remember to rent hanbok online, get ready for photo session! Have a feel to walk in the palace and surrounding in hanbok. Must come visit!"
A must if you want to learn about Korean history
"Worth a visit because of its cultural significance and cheap entry cost, but otherwise it's very large without much shade, and there is no way to buy water inside, forcing you to leave. There is no re-entry allowed. You could spend all day here and probably not see all of it, so I recommend you do some research beforehand to focus on the areas you'd like to see. We walked over 6km. BRING WATER."
"Soooo pretty palace, does not matter how many times I visited, I still love this palace"
Impresionante
Honestly the way it looks it is so peaceful and makes all your worries shatter
We're good 
"This was a beautiful area to walk around and learn some Korean history. The ticket price was very reasonable. We rented hanboks for the day, so admission was free. The ground were lovely and expansive. Rent an audio tour or just peacefully enjoy the palace. Of all the palaces in Seoul, this is the main one and a must."
"They have free English tours; just check the timings on the website! The tour guide was very knowledgable and friendly as well. The palace is very clean and well-maintained, which made the experience very enjoyable! There's also a palace museum with free entry to check out as well "
Wore Hanbok and got free entry to the palace. A nice place to take lots of pictures.
Excellent view of how Korea was in the past. There are free tours and the entry fee is pretty cheap
One of the best ancient sites to visit when visiting Seoul. Highly recommended
Superb 
Really great attraction. At 10am on a weekday we got to see the royal guards performing
I love Korean palace. Contact me if you need a guide
This iconic palace was the main royal palace of the Joseon dynasty. This palace was built in 1395.
"Nice huge palace, especially the garden. The secret garden should be visited if you have a chance to go there."
"This lovely autum, Hanbok style, is a must "
"Beautiful palace, cheap entry, they have multiple shows at 11am and 1pm."
"Quite a nice and expansive place! A lot of things to see and while it was busy, there were quite spots to sit down and relax. Many picture taking opportunities all around!"
Amazing place
"Gyeongbokgung Palace is arguably the most beautiful, and remains the largest of all five palaces."
beautiful place!
Very nice large palace..better to visit in spring fall or winter due to heat..wonderful photo ops in Hanbok attire. Can get in free if dressed in Hanbok.
Fantastic. No more comment necessary
"Should be on the top of your list for tourist attractions in Seoul. Lots of pretty grounds and historical buildings. Well maintained, and easy to navigate."
This is a must see if your in Seoul. 10 and 12 has the changing of guard ceremony which was very neat to see.
"A must visited place when you are a k-drama lover. You can take so many instagrammable photo there. You'll see the royal changing guard ceremony in every 15 minutes. You can take a pict with the guards as well. Anyway, if you need hanbok to wear then you don't need to be confused. You cam find the hanbok rental near to the palace."
"It¡¯s an amazing place. I liked that I could borrow a traditional outfit in the area. We can meet a lot of people in this outfit. When I come back to Korea, I want to visit this place again. I recommend leaving in the morning when there are not so many people."
Nice place to strolling around the central of Seoul city
This place is just stunning! Come here in the day and night and you will be amazed by the sheer beauty of this place! There are also guard changing ceremonys at 2pm from what I remember! So definitely go just before then. And definitely take your time to explore the whole place!
"Very nice temple, with lots of gardens and different buildings to visit. A must do in Seoul."
"Amazing historical place which you must visit! If you don¡¯t want to pay and go in there, just walk in around the palace alongside the walls. You will see lots of people who are wearing Hanbok(Korean traditional clothes) and having a tour. So beautiful!"
Great place to visit
It's really big so there's a lot of walking but it's really pretty too and they have guided tours in English during certain times and it's closed on Tuesdays
The Palace is beautiful after sunset. You can get tickets in advance via their website or what might be easier is showing up day of at the ticketing office at 6:30pm to queue up for evening ticket sales that begin at 7:00pm. Foreigners need to show passport and they allot a certain number (unknown how many) of tickets to foreigners every day.
"A trip to the past, you will find gorgeous views and so much Korean History. You will not be disappointed. Will go back"
Amazing place! If you wear hanbok you can get in for free!
Long history of South Korea
"Obowiazkowy punkt na mapoe Seulu. Niespotykana architektura, za dodatkowa.oplata mozliwosc przeprabania sie w tradycyjne koreanskie stroje."
"Gyeongbokgung was originally constructed in 1394 by King Taejo, the first king and the founder of the Joseon dynasty, and its name was conceived by an influential government minister named Jeong Do-jeon. Afterwards, the palace was continuously expanded during the reign of King Taejong and King Sejong the Great. It was severely damaged by fire in 1553, and its costly restoration, ordered by King Myeongjong, was completed in the following year. However, four decades later, the Gyeongbokgung Palace was burnt to the ground during the Japanese invasions of Korea of 1592-1598. The royal court was moved to the Changdeokgung Palace. The Gyeongbokgung palace site was left in ruins for the next three centuries.[4] 19th century Edit In 1867, during the regency of Daewongun, the palace buildings were reconstructed and formed a massive complex with 330 buildings and 5,792 rooms. Standing on 4,657,576 square feet (432,703 square meters) of land, Gyeongbokgung again became an iconic symbol for both the Korean nation and the Korean royal family. In 1894, the Japanese Japanese occupied the palace and forced Gojong to establish a pro-Japanese government. In 1895, after the assassination of Empress Myeongseong by Japanese agents, her husband, Emperor Gojong, left the palace. The Imperial Family never returned to Gyeongbokgung.[5] Early photographs of the reconstructed palace Throne Hall (1906) Throne Hall (c.1900) Throne (c.1900) Ceiling of Throne Hall (c.1900) Geoncheonggung (c.1900) The Japanese General Government Building standing in front of Geunjeongmun Gate prior to its demolition (1995-96) In 1915, it was used as the site for the Joseon Industrial Exhibition with new exhibition buildings being erected in the grounds.[6][7] Starting from 1911, the colonial government of the Empire of Japan systemically demolished all but 10 buildings during the Japanese occupation of Korea and hosted numerous exhibitions in Gyeongbokgung, ongoing demotion was opposed by Yanagi S?etsu. In 1926, the government constructed the massive Japanese General Government Building in front of the throne hall, Geunjeongjeon [ko], in order to eradicate the symbol and heritage of the Joseon dynasty. Gwanghwamun Gate, the main and south gate of Gyeongbokgung, was relocated by the Japanese to the east of the palace. A further exhibition, the Chosun Exhibition, followed in 1929.[8] The palace faced further damage when the wooden structure of the relocated Gwanghwamun Gate was completely destroyed amid the devastation of the Korean War. Gyeongbokgung's original 19th-century palace buildings that survived both the Japanese rule of Colonial Korea and the Korean War include: Geunjeongjeon (the Imperial Throne Hall) ? National Treasure No. 223. Gyeonghoeru Pavilion ? National Treasure No. 224. Hyangwonjeong Pavilion; Jagyeongjeon Hall; Jibokjae Hall; Sajeongjeon Hall; and Sujeongjeon Hall. Modern archaeological surveys have brought 330 building foundations to light. Restoration Edit Gyeongbokgung today In 1989, the South Korean government started a 40-year initiative to rebuild the hundreds of structures that were destroyed by the colonial government of the Empire of Japan, during the period of occupied Colonial Korea (1910-1945). In 1995, the Japanese General Government Building, after many controversial debates about its fate, was demolished in order to reconstruct Heungnyemun Gate and its cloisters. The National Museum of Korea, then located on the palace grounds, was relocated to Yongsan-gu in 2005. By the end of 2009, it was estimated that approximately 40 percent of the structures that were standing before the Japanese occupation of Korea were restored or reconstructed.[9] As a part of phase 5 of the Gyeongbokgung restoration initiative, Gwanghwamun, the main gate to the palace, was restored to its original design. Another 20-year restoration project is planned by the South Korean government to restore Gyeongbokgung to its former status.[10]"
Beautiful place full of history!
Beautiful place
The Palace is awesome... You can rent Hanbok 15000 won for 2 hours and get free entry to the palace. Don't stay too long at the main gate. The are many interesting places inside with the less crowd
Amazing the visit at night .
Very nice
Great place to visit in Seoul. The buildings are massive and beautiful. It costs about 3000 won to get in. But people in the local attire (Hanbok) can get in for free. Great scenery and well maintained

Rich in culture and traditional
Recommended to with group not alone 
Gyeongbokgung Palace. There are 5 palaces in Seoul. So it actually brings a new meaning to palace hopping in Seoul if you are thinking of what to do. This one is the biggest of the 5 and is located right beside the national palace museum so that you can start your palace hopping journey right. During the month of April and May. There are also night tours which is quite a popular activity with the locals.
Nice very good
Interesting palace with a beautiful pond in the middle. We had a lot of fun walking around the buildings in the middle and admiring those who rented costumes to dress up. There are guided tours but I think they are only available in Korean at the moment due to the pandemic.
"It is located in Seoul, the capital city of south korea. This place is very good to see cherry blossoms that bloomed a lot in spring. Because it is my favorite place. Gyeongbokgung was place where kings lived during the Joseon. So, i went sightseeing, i remembered the daily life of the kings. It made me more interesting. Gyeongbokgung is visit at night, you can see the colorful house. You can also experience traditional games at a nearby folk museum. It is one of the must-visit places if you visit Korea."
"MY perfect visit to Gyeongbokgung palace. It is located in seoul, the capital city of south korea. If you come to Gyeongbokgung palace alone, the entrance fee is 3,000 won if you come to Gyeongbokgung palace as a group, the entrance fee is 2,400 won. Admission is usually from nice to six.

"I visited Gyeongbokgung Palace. It is located in Seoul, the capital of South Korea. Gyeongbokgung Palace was completed in 1395. However, it has been damaged many times and has been under restoration since 1990. The admission fee for both Koreans and foreigners is 3,000 won for those aged 25 to 64, and 1,500 won for foreign students. Visiting hours vary from month to month, from 9 am to 5 pm or 6 pm. It is also open at night in spring and autumn. The entrance fee is the same, and the hours are from 7:00 PM to 9:30 PM. It is recommended because you can enjoy the beautiful history and traditions of Korea to your heart's content."
"I would like to introduce my experience of visiting Gyeongbokgung palace Located in Seoul the capital of the Republic of Korea, it is a symbolic palace representing the Republic of Korea. what I learned through this place was that there were two fires. The fire broke out in 1592 during the Japanese Invasion of Korea in 1592, and was rebuilt in 1865, but the fire broke out in 1867. when I went there, I felt that the palace was bigger than I thought and the garden was as big as a soccer field. And when I was there, I just imagined that I would be king. But it really felt like I was king If you come to Korea or live there, I would be finitely recommend this place."
"I'd like to share my experience of visiting Gyeongokgung palace. it is located in Seoul. Gyeongbokgung palace was the biggest palace's admission fees are about 3000 won but if you wear hanbok, it's free. I was most impressed by Gyeonghoeru. Because the Gyeonghoeru floating in the middle of the river was very pretty. and i was impressed by Geoncheonggung. Geonceonggung is the place where Empress Myeongseong was killed in the past. I was amazed watching the Geonceonggung when I know it. Gyeongbokgung Palace is sometimes open at night, but unfortunately, I didn't see the night opening of Gyeongbokgung Palace. I heard that Gyeongbokgung Palace is very pretty at night. If you want to experience the culture of Gyeongbokgung Palace, visit there!"
"The best attraction l've ever visited is Gyeongbokgung. The first thing to explan is the Gyeongbokgung history. After Joseon was founded in 1398, two crown princes were killed due to conflicts between meritorious subjects and princes and king Taejo handed over the throne to king jeongjong and left. After the princes's rebellion king Jeongjong left Gyeongbokgung palace and ruled the country in Gyeongbokgung In 1868, Heungseong Daewongur restored Gyeongbokgung palace to strengthen the royal authority. Second, the ingredientd used to make Gyeongbokgung. Third, the location of Gyeongbokgung palace is located in Jong-gu,seoul, Gyeongbokgung gyeplong pavillion is a representative cultural property Gyeonghoeru is Gyeonghoeru pavilion, national treasure No224, was ordered by king Taejong even though the air condition agency, Ja-cheong, was technicallydiffcult It is a large-scal pavlil on an artificial pond that has been achieved despite this. People visit several times to engrave meaning in various cultural properties, including Gyeongbokgunghoeru pavilion."
It's a beautiful place!
"I'd like to share my experience of visiting Gyeong-bok-gung Palace. It is located in Seoul, the capital of Korea, and you can take the subway and get off at Gyeong-bok-gung Station. What is amazing about Gyeong-bok-gung Palace is that admission is free when you weat hanbok. Gyeong-bok-gung Palace is a place of the Chosun period and there are good cultural heritage such as Gyeonghoeru, Hyangjeongwon and Heungryemun gate. These cultural heritage are operated at night, and the scenery is so beautiful. There were many things to do at Gyeong-bok-gung Palace, as much as there were many things to see. I recommend what you could do at Gyeong-bok-gung Palace. It has many good places to take pictures, and you can see the Eogaprocession in front of Gyeong-bok-gung Palace. Also, if you walk around in hanbok, even though it c memories! I'm sure it'll be a great experience."
"My perfact visit to Gyeongbokgung place I'd like to share my experience of visiting Gyeongbokgung place. It is located in seoul, the capital city of southkorea Gyeongbokgung place was built in 1395. After being converted into a goverment-general of korea by the japanese occupiers to stem the sprits of the korea people finally, Gyeongbokgung place was restored to its former glory Gyeongbokgung Palace is usually open from 9 am to 5 pm.

Gyeongbokgung Palace is recommended because you can rent a beautiful hanbok and take beautiful photos."
Ancient cultural sites are always must sees...
"I'd like to share my experience of visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace. It is located in Seoul, South Korea. The way to go to Gyeongbokgung Palace is simple. Take the subway and get off at Gyeongbokgung station. There is an entrance fee for each age, but it is free if you wear Hanbok. I didn't wear Hanbok, but I want to wear Hanbok next time. Gyeongbokgung Palace was founded by Yi Seong-gye of Joseon Dynasty, and was burnded twice in the war and restored again. The harmony between the old palace and the people wearing hanbok was beautiful. I highly recommend going to Gyeongbokgung Palace."
"I will introduce Gyeongbokgung, the place I went during my middle school field trip. It's bigger than Changgyeongung but smaller than changdeokgung. I recommmend watching it at night rather than during the day. Because the view at night is much prettier. Addmission to the place is generally 3000won per person. It opens at night in the first and second half of the year. The night opening date for the first half of the year is between April and May. You should book the ticket online. I'll tell you the history of thr palace. During the Japanese colonial period, the Japanese buildings were built to block Geunjeongjeon Hall and Gwanghwamun Gate. But now it has been restored. I really recommend this place. The experience there will be invaluable. I hope you go there at least once."
"The experience that I went to gyeongbokgung palace was really good. Gyeongbokgung palace was built in 1395. It's located in Jongno-gu, Seoul. Gyeongbokgung palace is twice as big as Seoul land. You can go there by bus 109 or 171. Also, you can go through exit 5 of Gyeongbokgung station line 3 or exit 2 of Gwanghwamun station line 5. It's closer than you think because you can get off the subway and walk for 5 to 10 minutes. The scenery of Gyeongbokgung palace is prettier in spring. When I saw many people visiting Gyeongbokgung palace, I felt like the servants and a king of the Joseon dynasty were gathered together."
"My perfect visit to Gyeong-bok-gung palace I¡¯d like to share my experience of visiting Gyeong-bok-gung place. It located in seoul the capital city of South Korea There are many buildings in Gyeongbokgung Palace Among them, I recommend going to Gwanghwamun and Geunjeongjeon Because these buildings represent Gyeongbokgung Palace And Gyeong-bok-gung palace open at night so l suggest you go at night Finally for this reason I strongly recommend a vist to Gyeong-bok-gung palace"
"My visit to Gyeongbokgung place. I¡¯d like to share my experience visiting Gyeongbokgung place. It is located in Seoul, the capital city of South Korea. The admission fees to Gyeongbokgung is 3,000won, but if you wear Hanbok, It¡¯s free. It¡¯s smaller than other old palaces like Changdeokgung or Gyeongbokgung, but I could feel something different mood here. Gyeongbokgung was the first palace of the Chosun era, which is a huge palace with 7,600 compartments. Gyeongbokgung means to enjoy great blessings. Finally, Gyeongbokgung has beautiful night view. So, I recommend you go to Gyeongbokgung"
"I'd like to introduce a wonderful place to visit in Seoul Gyeongbokgung Palace The easiest way to get there is taking Line 3and getting off at Gyeongbokgung Station It's a five minute Walk Admission for aged 7-18 is 1,500 won but it's free to wear Hanbok It was complected 3 years after the Joseon Dynasty was founded by King Taejo With Mount Bugaksan to its rear and Mount Namsan in the foreground history Also the Japanese Government- General was constructed in the front of the main sector of Palace I really recommend it because you can wear Hanbok at Gyeongbokgung Palace and think about the Local Heritage of Korea with your family or lovers"
"Gyeongbokgung palace is located in jongno-gu, Seoul. If you take subway line 3 and exit 4 of Gyeongbokgung station , you can go there. The entrance fee to Gyeongbokgung palace is 3000 won, and if you wear Hanbok, it is free. Gyeongbokgung palace was built during the reign of king Taejo of the Joseon dynasty. And It exists after the Japanese invasion of korea in 1592. If you want to feel the atmosphere of Joseon¡¯s history that is over 700 years old and want to see a symbol that means Korea is an independent country, I recommend Gyeongbokgung palace."
"I'd like to share my experience of visiting Gyeong bokgung Plalace.It is located in Jongno-gu,Seoul.It opens 9am to 5pm from Novenber to February.And it depends on season.At summer and fall it opens longer than winter. I learned that the palace is the most imfortant palace in Joseon.And it was builded by Yi Seonggye but it was burned by Japan at Japanese Invasion of Korea in 1592.However, it was restored by Heungseon Daewongun to strengthen the throne. There is ritual that change a sumunjang and it is performed twice a day.The ritual involved a Korean traditional music parade.It is a good experience for me, because it is't common experience It is worth visiting for taking a picture and for having a new experience.I strongly recommed a visit to Gyeong bokgung Palace. And lastly I will give you a tip.you should go early.If you go early, you can take a picture without other people."
"My perfect visit to Gyeong-bok-gung Place. It is located Palace of the Joseon Dynasty in Sejong-ro, Jongno-gu, Seoul. It's a royal palace of Joseon that means to prosper while enjoying great blessings. I learned that Gyeong-bok-gung Palace was burned down during the Japanese Invasion of Korea. So, when Heungseon Daewongun rebuilt it. it became the symbolic face of Seoul again. I'm beginning to wonder what it would be like now if it hadn't been rebuilt. Gyeong-bok-gung Palace is also open at night. The palace lights up at night, but the feeling of seeing it during the day and at night is different. so people wear hanbok and visit a lot at night. I was impressed by the beautiful harmony between the night view of Gyeong-bok-gung Palace and Hanbok. It is a good place to take a slow walk and see the scenery. It is fun to see because there are many people wearing hanbok, and above all, if you like pretty flowers, scenery, and walking, I highly recommend it!"
"My perfect visit to Gyeong-bok-gung Palace. I¡¯d like to share my experience of visiting Gyeong-bok-gung Palace. It has very good photo spots, so many people visit and take pictures. Also, there is a Hanbok rental shop near Gyeong-bok-gung Palace, so many people rent it and take pictures. Hanbok is a korean traditional clothes. It is very beautiful. Gyeong-bok-gung Palace has gatekeepers. They guard it and protect king with a weapon weaponry. The night at Gyeong-bok-gung Palace is very beautiful. By turning on the lighting, it maximizes the beauty of Gyeong-bok-gung Palace. So I strongly recommand a visit to Gyeong-bok-gung Palace."
Great and must see tourist attraction in Soul. Very well maintained palace despite the history of it. Pick a nice sunny day to visit it.
"Such a beautiful palace! Wear your hanbok when you go there - highly recommend! Entrance to the palaces is free of charge if you¡¯re wearing hanbok. If you don¡¯t own one and you¡¯re a foreigner, don¡¯t worry. There are plenty of hanbok rentals outside the palace. You can rent it for a few hours or for the whole day. If you want to explore the palace, I highly recommend that you rent the hanbok for the day so that way you¡¯re not rushing. The palace ground is big and it took us more than four hours to explore it. Wear comfortable shoes! I also recommend bringing packed lunch/snack and water. There are areas/benches where you can sit down and eat. Lastly, take time to explore the palace and take lots of pictures! Oh by the way, we got there right when the palace opened, around 10am, and we¡¯re able to watch the ceremony. It was really cool!"
Nice place to visit
"Fun and relaxing to walk around, nothing too special though. Cheap entrance price."
"This place is huge. Be prepared to walk a lot and bring water as you will be in the sun. They offer English tours so best to check ahead and time your visit with the tours, otherwise you will be walking around looking at old buildings which can be pretty boring w/o hearing the back story."
"This is an interesting place to spend a major part of a day. Don¡¯t forget to watch the changing of the guards, a highlight that occurs several times a day. Also make reservations online for a time to visit the Gyeonghoeru pavilion."
"Impressive and interesting palace though we preferred nearby Changdeokgung Palace, which has a more scenic setting. Gyeongbokgung is more out in the open. In addition to the palace buildings, the main things we liked about Gyeongbokgung were the changing of the guard ceremony and nearby location to the Blue House and Bukchon Hanok Village, which were both worth visiting."
"In going to Gyeongbokgung palace, you have an option to rent a hanbok from the nearby rental shops. They usually costs around 10,000-25,000 \, depending on design and gender style (men's are more costly). You don't need to buy tickets to enter the palace grounds if you're wearing a hanbok so remember that before you book online."
"It wasn't very busy when I visited (a Monday in June), and I loved wandering around for hours just enjoying the lovely architecture and nature. There were (free!) English- speaking tours, but I found exploring myself and reading the plentiful information signs to be more than enough to get a feel for this historic place. As other reviewers note, a must in Seoul!"
"This is must stop place. We rented hanboks for the day, so admission was free. The ground were lovely and expansive. Rent an audio tour or just peacefully enjoy the palace."
"Of Seoul's 5 Palaces, this is THE Palace to see. Built 1395, destroyed 1590's, rebuilt 1800's, destroyed again in the 1940's, restored once more in the 1990's, it's not just a wonderful escape from the hubbub of Seoul, it's a walk through Korea's history. Especially when you wonder through the gate to Korea's Folk Museum. Well worth the visit."
"Of all the palaces in Seoul, this is the main one and a must.? If your limited on time, definitely do this one.? As you can imagine, busy but with Korea having just reopened after C-19, not as bad as pre-pandemic times.? Go early.? I got there at 09:00 as it opened and I was done by noon.? It was packed by then.? Grounds are huge, when it starts to get hot you will struggle in the heat.? Entrance is cheap.? I timed my visit so I walked around for an hour, watched the Royal Guard Changing Ceremony at 10:00 (around fifteen minutes), walked around some more and then joined the free English guided tour at 11:00 for one hour. Check online the night before as they change timings and closure days. Perfect.? My free time allowed me to explore and the guided tour was good providing an overview to some of the main buildings as well as details I didn't notice walking alone.? Guided tours are not in many languages.? English was the only European language but this may be due to the limited tourists at present.? Take water with.? I may be wrong but there only appeared to be one cafe inside.? If you don't do the free guided tour, there are information booklets but staff are not that friendly and don't volunteer this information.? After you have purchased a ticket, go through the main entrance and on the right are the booklets in a few languages.? There are also information boards at some of the palace buildings with a few facts.? At the time of writing June, 2022 adult entry for a foreigner is 3,000 Korean Won.? If you wear the traditional Korean hanbok outfit (assume you can hire this nearby), then you can go in for free.? A lot of people were doing this but check the price first.? Unless you want to dress up and take photographs then do it.? If your doing it to go in free, the entrance is cheap and I think hiring the outfit may cost more!? Plus it is really hot (depending when you go).? The National Folk Museum of Korea is located at the back, free to enter.? Highly recommend going.? Although I was tired I did this after the palace (spent about an hour at the museum) and it was really good.? In total I was there for four hours to cover both.? Grounds are clean and well laid out.? If you do the museum, you cannot go back into the palace so do it after you have finished at the palace.? The museum exits into a main road where you can easily get public transport or a taxi."
"Mostly reconstructed complex from the Joseon era (Japanese damage and fires, etc.). They have obviously taken pains to rebuild the major structures using period techniques and we watched some craftmen working on one building with only hand tools. One pavilion needed two large trees of a variety that were no longer available in Korea so they were located and shipped from Canada!"
This was a beautiful area to walk around and learn some Korean history. The ticket price was very reasonable. Very nice gift shop/cafe.
